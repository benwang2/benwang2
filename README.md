## Hi there 👋  
Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a software engineer at AT&T who loves tinkering, automating, and occasionally breaking things just to figure out how to fix them better. I work with tools like Python, SQL, and a variety of frameworks to turn ideas into reality.  

---

### 🛠 **What I’m Into:**  
- **Code:** I’m all about finding elegant solutions to messy problems. Whether it’s scripting something quick or diving deep into frameworks, I love turning ideas into working systems.  
- **Learning:** New tech? New languages? New challenges? Sign me up. I’m always exploring ways to level up my skills and see how far I can push the limits of what I know.  
- **Mechanical Keyboards:** Because typing should be as satisfying as coding. My collection might be a little out of hand (you can never have too many switches, right?), but hey, every key press is an experience.
- **Coffee, Matcha, & Assorted Teas:** I run on warm, caffeinated drinks—whether it’s a perfectly brewed pour-over, a creamy matcha latte, or a classic cup of tea, they’re the fuel behind my debugging sessions.

### 🎉 **Fun Facts About Me:**
- I wrote my first line of code following a YouTube tutorial for Roblox scripting—and I’ve been hooked ever since.  
- I might spend more time customizing my keyboard layouts than actually typing on them.  
- When I’m not coding, I’m probably obsessing over the perfect linear switch or trying to convince myself I don't need another keyboard.
